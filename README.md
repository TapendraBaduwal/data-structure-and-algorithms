### Python

Python is object. Everything is object in python. Strings are objects, Lists are objects, Functions are objects and Even modules are also objects.

Python is using a pure object model where classes are instances of a meta-class “type” in Python, the terms “type” and “class” are synonyms. And “type” is the only class which is an instance of itself.

Except for the Python keywords like “if def, globals”, using type(<name>) or dir(<name>) or just type the resource name and press enter- will work on pretty much anything.

### Natural Language Processing

[NLP problems and datasets](https://github.com/MadanBaduwal/NLP-problems-and-datasets)

#### Introduction,tools and some basic components

**Corpus(files):** Large collection of text documents,such as books, news articles, etc. "corpora" = plural form of corpus

* Corpus is  a large collection of texts used for studying language. A corpus is usually annotated (=word are labelled with information about the part of speech and grammatical category). The terms corpus and text corpus and language corpus are interchangeable. Using a corpus for any type of linguistic or language oriented work ensures the outcomes reflect the real use of the language.


**Lexicon(शब्दकोश)(data in data structure):** A lexicon is a collection of words. It is like a dictionary(list of vocabulary). Each word may have additional information like part of speech (noun, verb, etc.) and the meaning/definition.

Corpus diyako x vanyasi .txt file deko x vanni bujni. And lexicon diyako x vanyasi collection of words diyako x vanni bujni.

**Dictionary(data in data structure)** : Collection of words.

Example : Dictionary : 
  {'This': 0, 'first': 1, 'is': 2, 'line': 3, 'These': 4, 'are': 5, 'lines': 6, 'second': 7, 'third': 8}


**Tokenization(process):** Tokenization is the process of breaking corpus into sentences or sentence and phrase into smaller units called tokens(words).
    * Word Tokenization
	* Sentence Tokenization

**Frequency distribution :** We can explore the frequence distribution of words.


**Encoding :** Unicode is a string character that we see. However, disk text is stored in an encoded form. Few popular encodings are UTF-8, ASCII, Latin-2.


**Linguistic :** The scientific study of language is known as linguistics.

**Phoenetics and Phonology :** Phoenitics and Phonology is the study of knowledge on linguistic sounds.

**Morphology :** Morphology is the study of structure and formation of words from smaller units called morphemes.
   * the study of the forms of things.
   * a particular form, shape, or structur
   * English mainly uses prefixes and suffixes to express inflectional and derivational morphology. 

   * Example : cat-cats,walk-walks,computerize-computerization...

**Syntax :** Syntax deals with the knowledge of structural relationship between words.

**Semantics :** Semantics deals with the knowledge of meaning of words that makeup a phrase or a sentence. Relating to meaning in language or logic.


**Pragmatics(paragraph) :** Pragmatics deals with the study of relationship between the meaning of the word / phrases / sentences inrelation to the intention of the speaker.

**Discourse(प्रवचन) :** written or spoken communication or debate.

**Pragmatics Vs Discourse:** Pragmatics deals with the context of a sentence and determines its meaning referencing that aprticular context where as discourse refers to understanding the language in actual communication with larger units like paragraphs.


**What are some of the lower level components?**
- **Tokenization**: breaking text into tokens (words, sentences, n-grams)
- **Stopword removal**: a/an/the
- **Stemming and lemmatization**: root word
- **TF-IDF**: word importance
- **Part-of-speech tagging**: noun/verb/adjective
- **Named entity recognition**: person/organization/location
- **Spelling correction**: "New Yrok City"
- **Word sense disambiguation**:identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence. eg: "buy a mouse"
- **Segmentation**: Text segmentation is the process of dividing written text into meaningful units, such as words, sentences, or topics. eg : "New York City subway"
- **Language detection**: "translate this page"
- **Machine learning**

#### Bag of word > Word embedding (each word to numerical value)

Types of word embedding:

Why is NLP hard?

** __Ambiguity__**

Human language is highly ambiguous instead of computer language(programming language), which is not vague by design. 


 Let's discuss different types of ambiguity that occur in language.

$\textbf{1. Phonological ambiguity:}$


Phonological ambiguity can be described as words that sound similar(same) but are different in meaning. Such ambiguity arises on a dialogue-based system.

For example,

  - __I__ vs. __Eye__
  - __No__ vs. __Know__
  - __Peace__ vs. __Piece__

$\textbf{2. Lexical ambiguity:}$  
A lexeme is a smallest or basic unit of the lexicon in language that bears some meaning. A lexicon is a list of all words(vocabulary) used in a particular language or dictionary. 

Lexical ambiguity can be described as words that have identical form but have unrelated or distinct meanings. 


For example,

   - __bank__ - commercial bank vs. river bank
   - __mean__ - mathematical average vs. not nice


$\textbf{3. Syntactic  ambiguity:}$  

Syntax refers to the structural relationship between words.

In syntactic ambiguity, ambiguity arises not due to the presence of lexeme with several meanings, but because the sentence's syntactic structure causes multiple interpretations. It is also called structural ambiguity.

For example,

$$\textbf{The tourist saw the child with telescope}$$

There is two possible interpretation of the sentence:
   1. The tourist has a telescope, and he saw a child when watching through it.
   2. A child has a telescope, and the tourist saw him.


$\textbf{4. Semantic ambiguity:}$  

Semantics refers to the meaning of the words that make up a phrase or a sentence.

Even after the syntax and the meaning of the individual words have been resolved, there is still ambiguity in the sentence, which is demonstrated with the following example.

$$\textbf{Mark and Elizabeth got married last week.}$$

The ambiguity here is that if Mark and Elizabeth got married to each other or a different person.

$\textbf{5. Pragmatic ambiguity:}$  

Pragmatics refers to studying the relationship between the meaning of the word/phrases/sentences concerning the speaker's intention.

Sometimes, the whole context is needed to understand the meaning of individual sentences. For example,

$$\textbf{I love chicken.}$$

The above sentence can be interpreted in two ways based on two different contexts. First, if the person talks about the food they like, then chicken refers to the meat. Second, if people are animals they want, then chicken refers to the chicken as an animal.

- **Non-standard English**: tweets/text messages
- **Idioms**: "throw in the towel"
- **Newly coined words**: "retweet"
- **Tricky entity names**: "Where is A Bug's Life playing?"
- **World knowledge**: "Mary and Sue are sisters", "Mary and Sue are mothers"


**__How to avoid these ambiguities?__**

To avoid these ambiguities, we need an understanding of the world or context in which different words or the sentence as a whole are used. 

For example, the word "bank" appears in two different contexts, and if we are familiar with the context, this ambiguity is not a problem.

Similarly, in the sentence, "When a hammer hits the glass table, it shattered,". If we have the common sense that that hammer is made from metal and is unlikely to shatter, an ambiguous referal of the word "it" is no longer a problem.


Moreover, we will need to perform the different analysis levels like morphological analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, pragmatic analysis, etc. to avoid ambiguities. We will discuss these in upcoming chapters.
